# Super Budget tracker

## Description

Using nodeJS, mysql, sequelize, and TailwindCSS paired with Flowbite we were able to create The Super Budget tracker application which is a budget tracking web application that can track your desired budget and the transactions inputted by the user. Our motivation to create this application was so we could have an application to be able to easily track our transactions and to be able to see how much we have spent compared to our set budget. This application solves the problem of not keeping track of the money you spend. During the process of building this application we learned how to utilize Chart.js to render charts using data set by the user from the database. We also learned how to dynmically render a table from the database that relys on the current users session. Some difficultiies we encountered as a team were designing the UI with tailwind and handlebars, as well as difficulties with deleting the budget so the user can update their budget.
